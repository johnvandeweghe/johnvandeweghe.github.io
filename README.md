Husband, software engineer, tech nerd in Minneapolis, MN.

### Career in brief

I had a very fortunate upbringing in that I was exposed to algorithmic thinking from a very young age. I attended an elementry school that had us writing what was likely Logo to learn basic geometry. We were tasked with typing draw commands to move a turtle cursor. I also got to attend special lessons (still in elementry school) that had us using a graphical programing tool from MIT to build games and animations called Scratch.

Throughout middle school I taught myself basic html/css/js as well as some backend basics in PHP. I also delved into the land of Java through a custom game server implementation for a popular game at the time that I contributed minorly to.

In highschool I furthered my Java knowledge through java programming games, and building more and more projects in PHP. Later in highschool I joined Stackoverflow and began answering questions. Through this I learned of the world of freelancing, and began selling my skills througout my last two years in highschool. Through this I gained more skill programming, and also a fair amount of expirence dealing with clients and unclear requirements.
